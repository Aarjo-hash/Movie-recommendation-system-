# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The aim is to generate personalized movie suggestions by analyzing user behavior and rating patterns, instead of simply recommending what's popular.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 📊 **Collaborative Filtering**  
  Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users or similar movies.

- 🧮 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  Implements user-user and item-item collaborative filtering by finding the most similar entities.

- 📐 **Cosine Similarity**  
  Measures the similarity between users or movies in the rating matrix for more accurate recommendations.

- 🔍 **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**  
  Reduces the dimensionality of the user-item matrix and fills in missing values by learning latent features.

- 📈 **Model Evaluation**  
  Uses RMSE and precision metrics to evaluate how well the model predicts unseen ratings.

## 🧠 Steps Followed in This Project

1. **Library Imports and Setup**  
   Loaded essential Python libraries including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and Surprise.

2. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**  
   Loaded the movie ratings dataset and performed basic EDA to understand user behavior and data distribution.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing data
   - Filtered out sparse users/movies
   - Converted the dataset into a usable user-item matrix

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Calculated similarity matrices using cosine similarity
   - Built dictionaries of similar movies or users

5. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented collaborative filtering using:
     - KNNBasic
     - SVD from Surprise
   - Trained models to learn from past user ratings

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model performance using RMSE
   - Compared models across different configurations
   - Analyzed top-N recommendation performance

7. **Visualization**  
   - Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize rating distributions, popularity, and similarity clusters

8. **Interpretation**  
   - Interpreted prediction accuracy and assessed limitations of each model type

## 📁 Dataset

- Utilized the **MovieLens 100k** dataset (or your own custom dataset)
- Key features:
  - `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, `timestamp`
  - `title`, `genres` (from a linked metadata file)
- High sparsity handled through matrix factorization and similarity filtering

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🧠 **Add Content-Based Filtering**  
  Use genres, plot descriptions, or tags to recommend based on movie metadata

- 🧪 **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**  
  Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for more robust recommendations

- 📈 **Deep Learning Models**  
  Explore AutoEncoders, Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), and transformers

- 🔁 **Real-Time Updates**  
  Integrate live user feedback and update the recommendation engine on the fly

- 🌍 **User Personalization**  
  Build user profiles over time to improve long-term recommendation quality

- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  Analyze user reviews and movie descriptions for sentiment and keyword extraction

- 🌐 **Deployment**  
  Turn the system into a fully functional web app using Streamlit or Flask

- 📊 **Explainability & Trust**  
  Add explanations for why a movie was recommended (e.g., “You liked Inception and Interstellar”)

## ✅ Summary

This project demonstrates the power of collaborative filtering in building intelligent recommendation systems. By implementing and comparing techniques like KNN and SVD, the system effectively predicts user preferences and suggests relevant movies. It lays the foundation for deeper personalization, hybrid models, and even web-scale deployment in the future.
